<p>The United States Energy Information Administration (EIA) offers thousands of free data sets publicly, and they can all be found on their website <a href="https://www.eia.gov/opendata/">here</a>. I believe that each of the datasets can be downloaded as a CSV, however there is also an option to access the data through the EIA API. Today, I will be working with some data that I manually downloaded from the EIA website with generator level information. A future post may address how to use the EIA API to programatically use the data.</p>
