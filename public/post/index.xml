      <description>Hi there! My name is Greg and this is my first blog, so I’m unsure what this will turn into. I currently work at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and really enjoy my job. In college I studied Energy and Environmental Policy and then continued on to get my Masters degree in Agriculture and Resources Economics. I have long been interested in the energy industry so the topics discussed in this blog will largely fall within those bounds.</description>
