      <description>Hi there! My name is Greg and this is my first blog. Iâ€™m unsure what this will turn into, but I have interests in the energy sector and soccer. Since moving to DC and getting a real job I have also followed politics a bit more closely, but I am unsure if that is a good thing.
Thanks for checking this out, I hope to write more posts in the future!</description>
