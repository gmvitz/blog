      <description>The United States Energy Information Administration (EIA) offers thousands of free data sets publicly, and they can all be found on their website here. I believe that each of the datasets can be downloaded as a CSV, however there is also an option to access the data through the EIA API. Today, I will be working with some data that I manually downloaded from the EIA website with generator level information.</description>
